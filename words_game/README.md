# Words game

A small word-forming game on a board filled with random letters.

## Instructions

1. View the board: select option $1$ to print the current state of the game board. The board is filled with random letters.

2. Fill the board: if you want to change the board, select option $2$. This will refill the board with a new set of random letters.

3. Play the game: to play a round, select option $3$. You will be asked for the word you want to form, its orientation and direction. You score points based on the length of the word and the moves used.
